Perl Oasis 2010
===============

Perl Oasis will be a one-day workshop in Orlando on Saturday, January 16,
2010. It is modeled on last year's Frozen Perl Workshop, which was in turn
modeled on the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop, London Workshop and other European
events. We are guessing we will have at least the same attendance as Perl
Oasis had in 2010. The early bird registration rate will
be $10 for students, and $20 for everyone else. This will double approximately
a month before the workshop.

The workshop is being organized by the Orlando Perl Mongers. We would like
Level 2 sponsorship from the TPF. This is the same level we were at last year.

We have already reserved the Four Points Sheraton as our venue
(http://xrl.us/fourpointsorl). The total cost for this venue is $375 for 30
people and $8 per person after that. AV Equipment will be provided by HD
Publishing who have generously loaned us two High Definition LCD projectors.

At the Four Points we have secure a group rate of $75 USD / night and a current
block of 20 rooms. Because the Four Points is also our venue this is by far the
most convenient option, as we get a better assessment of our local vs. remote
attendee breakdown we will branch out to the other hotels in the area.

$1000 Without the AV costs our registration should be more than adequate to
cover our venue expenses. We can apply the remaining sponsorship money to
catering costs. The catering costs are included for 30 people, and are the $8
dollars per person after the first 30.

So far we have already secured $1000 in sponsorship commitments, and expect
further monies soon. I hope to be able to raise at least $2000 in sponsorship,
which should allow us to provide some additional social events.

Budget Expenses 
----------------

Listed in order in which they will receive funding:

    * Venue: $375 - this is the only required item
    * Hackathon: $150 
    * Conference Social Event(s): $400 (est)
    * Advertising: $100 (est)

Advertising costs are primarily for things like printing flyers. $100 may be a
gross overestimate, but it gives us some wiggle room.

There are also some additional expenses that are flexible, in that they can be
funded at various levels. These include buying food and beverages for the
Hackathon, drinks and/or food for a Friday night speaker & organizer's dinner.

These are all way down on the funding priority list, and will only get funding
if we have money "left over". 

Income
------

    * Sponsorship: $1000 (so far)
    * Registration fees: $145 (assumign 2009 levels)

As you can see from our budget, the event is very conservative financially,
since we already have a commitment of $1000 and the costs for the conference
is currently expected to be well under that we figure we are safe.
