Perl Oasis 2009
===============

Perl Oasis will be a one-day workshop in Orlando on Saturday, January 17,
2009. It is modeled on last year's Frozen Perl Workshop, which was in turn
modeled on the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop, London Workshop and other European
events. We are guessing we will have at least the same attendance as Frozen
Perl had in 2008 (100 people). The early bird registration rate will be $10
for students, and $20 for everyone else. This will double approximately 4
weeks before the workshop.

The workshop is being organized by the Orlando Perl Mongers. We are working
with HD Publishing Group who are Gold Level Sponsors.

We have already reserved the Ramada Gateway as our venue
(http://www.ramadagateway.com/). The total cost for this venue, (without
catering) is $650. AV Equipment will be provided by HD Publishing who have
generously loaned us two High Definition LCD projectors.

We are also planning a hackathon for the Sunday after the workshop. This will
be at the same Venue. The cost is included in the total above.

At the Ramada we have secure a group rate of $75 USD / night and a current
block of 10 rooms. Because the Ramada is also our venue this is by far the
most convenient option, as we get a better assessment of our local vs. remote
attendee breakdown we will branch out to the other hotels in the area.

Without the AV costs our registration should be more than adequate to
cover our venue expenses. We can apply the remaining sponsorship money to catering costs. The catering costs are expected to be $12.00 USD / person and include a beverage service and an attendee social event Saturday evening.

We expect to be able to cover our venue costs entirely from registration fees.
Given 56 non-students at $20 and 24 students at $10 each that would be $1360,
enough to pay for the venue.

So far we have already secured $2,500 in sponsorship commitments. I expect us
to be able to raise at least $3,000 in sponsorship, which should allow us to
provide some additional social events for families.

Budget Expenses 
----------------

Listed in order in which they will receive funding:

    * Venue: $650 - this is the only required item
    * Conference Social Event: $1,985 (est)
    * Advertising: $100 (est)
    * Lunch & Dinner: $1,200 (est)
    * Morning beverages: $160 (est)
    * Afternoon beverages: $160 (est)

Advertising costs are primarily for things like printing flyers. $100 may be a
gross overestimate, but it gives us some wiggle room.

Obviously, the catering costs will vary based on the number of attendees, and
there is some flexibility based on what exact food we purchase. The numbers
above are all based on a figure of 100 attendees.

There are also some additional expenses that are flexible, in that they can be
funded at various levels. These include buying food and beverages for the
Hackathon, drinks and/or food for a Friday night speaker & organizer's dinner.

These are all way down on the funding priority list, and will only get funding
if we have money "left over". 

Income
------

    * Registration fees: $1,360 (56 non-students, 24 students, all early bird)
    * Sponsorship: $Everything else

As you can see from our budget, the event is very conservative financially,
since we could cover costs with no sponsorship, and we already have a
commitment of $2,500, putting else well into the black before we've even
started.
